# Black Box Optimizer Repository Guidance

## Controlling Baseline

- Build a local Python 3.13.14 application that optimizes an opaque external
  worker through command-line parameters and a one-row CSV metrics file.
- Run synchronously and sequentially, with no more than one worker process
  active at a time.
- Create one immutable `TrialRecord` for every attempted execution and append
  it to an append-only `TrialHistory`.
- Evaluate eligible records with mixed-direction Pareto dominance and return
  the complete non-dominated `ParetoFront`.
- Do not import or inspect worker internals, invent a weighted winner, or add
  networking, concurrency, databases, resume behavior, or extra algorithms to
  the MVP.

The architectural baseline given by Mel controls when draft planning documents
conflict with current decisions. Record and explain conflicts before changing
public contracts or architecture.

## Documentation Authority

- Recorded human decisions and this repository guidance control current work.
- `docs/architecture-baseline.md` contains the approved architectural
  invariants and MVP boundaries.
- Draft v0.2 under `docs/planning_baseline_v02` is the current detailed design
  guidance but remains pending team ratification and technical approval. It is
  not silently amended by merged code or scratch notes.
- Draft v0.1 under `docs/planning_baseline_v01` is historical source material,
  not current implementation guidance.
- `README.md` reports implementation status on `main`; `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` tracks
  reproduced defects in merged code. Neither file changes a public contract.
- When merged code and a controlled contract disagree, preserve the behavior,
  record the conflict, and obtain human agreement before changing either side.

## Ownership and Boundaries

- Mel owns the architectural baseline, internal contracts, optimizer/search,
  `TrialHistory`, persistence, Pareto evaluation, verification, and overall
  integration.
- Charles owns only the GUI. The GUI is an optional presentation layer and must
  not own or be required by optimizer logic.
- Reporting and result exports belong to their assigned teammate and must
  consume authoritative optimizer results without changing them.
- Example workers live outside the optimizer package. PyTorch may be used by
  the Iris example worker but must not become an optimizer dependency.

## Contract and State Rules

- Configuration, candidates, completed trial records, Pareto fronts, and final
  results must be immutable through public interfaces.
- `TrialHistory` may append internally but exposes only read-only tuple
  snapshots to search and evaluation code.
- Objective eligibility and Pareto membership are derived from a
  `TrialRecord` and `OptimizationContract`; do not store redundant flags.
- Preserve parameter order when constructing worker CLI arguments.
- Invoke workers with an argument list and `shell=False`.
- Give every authorized attempt a unique trial identifier and metrics path.
- Process success, metrics validity, and Pareto eligibility are distinct facts.

## Global Monolith Hygiene

- Run `python tools/check_monoliths.py` as part of verification.
- No source file may exceed 1,000 physical lines without explicit human
  approval recorded in `source_hygiene.json`.
- An approved exception must name the exact file, human approver, approval
  date, the file's single coherent responsibility, and why splitting it would
  make the design worse.
- Agents must not silently create, expand, or approve an oversized file.
- Lines should generally remain near 80 characters where practical. The
  checker reports long lines as design guidance rather than a hard failure.
- Tests, generated files, vendored dependencies, lockfiles, data files, and
  machine-generated artifacts may be excluded only through explicit checker
  configuration.
- The 1,000-line threshold is a warning signal for mixed responsibilities,
  coupling, and spaghetti-code risk. It is not a target or a score to game.
- Do not split code arbitrarily to satisfy the threshold. Split only at real
  responsibility boundaries with understandable interfaces.
- A collection of small but tightly coupled files can still violate this rule;
  passing the checker does not replace architectural review.
- The checker must clearly report unapproved oversized files and fail
  verification until a valid approved exception exists.

## Verification Expectations

- Add focused unit tests for pure validation and algorithms.
- Add integration tests across declared boundaries, beginning with the
  one-trial candidate-to-record vertical slice.
- Include a hand-calculated mixed-direction Pareto fixture.
- Keep tests deterministic and free of networking or concurrent worker trials.
- Before handing off a change, run the relevant tests and the global monolith
  checker, then update the scratch memory below.

## Change Control

Explain and obtain human agreement before changing JSON, CLI, CSV,
`TrialRecord`, eligibility, dominance, result, or persistence contracts. The
same requirement applies before adding a dependency or an excluded MVP
capability.

## Merged Interface Alignment Notes

These are descriptions of merged behavior, not permission to change a
controlled contract without human agreement:

- `load_configuration(path)` returns one immutable `ProjectConfiguration`.
- `create_algorithm(spec)` constructs the algorithm; the immutable
  `OptimizationContract` is supplied later to `propose(contract, history)`.
- `runner.execute(worker_spec, candidate, metrics_path)` returns private
  observation fields consumed immediately by the record factory.
- `build_trial_record(candidate, trial_id, metrics_path, execution_result)`
  constructs one immutable `TrialRecord`.
- `CandidateConfiguration` protects its mapping but does not prove legality
  against an `OptimizationContract`; that validation remains a required
  controller boundary before launch.
- The abbreviated TDS public-interface table differs from several of these
  signatures. Do not make code conform to that table, or treat these notes as
  an amendment to the TDS, without human agreement and document reconciliation.

## Scratch Memory - Update After Every Change

Keep this section brief and current. Update it after every repository change so
the next person can resume without reconstructing recent decisions.

- Last updated: 2026-08-01
- Current state: `main` implements immutable configuration, seeded RandomSearch,
  synchronous subprocess execution, metrics parsing, immutable `TrialRecord`,
  append-only `TrialHistory`, maximum-trial stop decisions, and the external
  Iris/PyTorch worker. The real-worker integration suite exercises search,
  runner, worker, metrics, records, history, and stop policy together. The
  application controller, durable persistence, full Pareto evaluation,
  results, reporting, and CLI are not on `main`, so no runnable optimizer entry
  point exists yet. An active remote controller branch is unmerged and must not
  be described as current `main` behavior.
- Decisions: This documentation realignment changes no JSON, CLI, CSV,
  `TrialRecord`, eligibility, dominance, result, persistence, or dependency
  contract. Use the authority order and merged-interface notes above. Keep
  PyTorch outside optimizer runtime imports. Continue timestamped work branches,
  non-squash merges, verified checkpoint tags, and deletion of merged branches.
- Verification: All 134 tests pass with dependencies under local Python 3.11.
  Python 3.13.14 is installed locally but does not yet have NumPy and PyTorch,
  so the required-interpreter suite remains unconfirmed there. The source
  hygiene checker passes across 31 scanned source files.
- Next work: Review and repair the unmerged application-controller branch before
  merge, including its persistence exception mismatch and the required
  pre-launch candidate-validation boundary. Then complete full Pareto
  dominance/front evaluation, result construction, reporting, and CLI
  composition. The merged runner diagnostic defect remains tracked in
  `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.
